## Motivation

## Technology

* Chrome Puppeteer
* RxJS 6
* TypeScript

## Pre-requisites:

* Node
* Yarn

## Configuration

* General configuration such as refresh interval and so on can be found on [config.ts](./src/config/config.ts)
* The queries to crawl against can be configured in [queries.ts](./src/config/queries)

## Usage

* Your environment must have the following environment variables set

  * `EMAIL_FROM`: name of sender
  * `EMAIL_TO`: whom to send the email
  * `EMAIL_USER`: sender email account username (i.e someone@gmail.com)
  * `EMAIL_PASSWORD`: sender email account password
  * `EMAIL_HOST`: Hostname of email provider, defaults to gmail ('smtp.gmail.com')

* `yarn start` will run the server

Example

* `EMAIL_FROM=xxx EMAIL_TO=foo@gmail.com EMAIL_USER=bar@gmail.com EMAIL_PASSWORD=12345 yarn run startyarn start` will fire the server and crawl for deals infinitely
* `yarn cleanStorage` will reset the storage so already notified deals will be retriggered on match
